  The stuff above was not necessary, it was used with justify-content center.
  The proper way is to just add space-between.

/* From the solutions, we need to center the logo in the center.
We can do that by adding a flex display to the whole container
and using align items center (vertically)
and justify content space-between (horizontally)
We can make the lists ordered horizontally by adding a flex display.
We can add a gap between each item with the gap property.
All of the containers inside the flexbox should be centered vertically and horizontally.
I added a left and right margin for the ul so that they get spaced out of the borders.
Padding needs to be removed from the ul box so that it doesn't get pushed to the right.
