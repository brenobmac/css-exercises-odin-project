/* First thing we need to do is make the li horizontal
We can do that by adding a flex display.
We also need to add a gap between each list item.
We also need to make EVERYTHING placed horizontally, so we add
a flex display to the header (which is the container that has everything
in it).
Inside the header, everything is centered vertically.
This means we need to align the items vertically in the header.
We add an 8px gap between all the items, which is indicated in the header.
We added a 16px padding for the content in the container.
We centered all the items by justifying the content.
Now that everything is centered, we can add the proper margins to position
everything the way we want to.
We can do this by adding a margin-right auto to the list items, which will
push the logo and the items to the left while pushiing the notification
to the right.
I noticed that the circle gets flattened when we reduce the browser size too much
so I removed the shrink from the profile image.
