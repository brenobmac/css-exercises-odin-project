/*# Margin and Padding #2

This one is a little nicer looking, and a little closer to something you might see in the real world. 
You'll need to change a little more than just margin and padding to make it look exactly right.

### Self Check
Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, 
but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- There is 8px between the edge of the card and its content (the blue sections) (add padding).
- There is an 8px gap between each of the blue sections inside the card (each blue section has an 8px margin).
- The title of the card uses a 16px font (add specified value for font size).
- There are 8px between the title text and the edge of the title section (this is confunsing, but means add left padding).
- The content section has 16px space on the top and bottom, and 8px on either side (top/botton padding and left/right padding).
- Everything inside the `.button-container` section is centered, and there is 8px padding (add specifications).
- The Big Button is centered on its own line (line break with block display and auto margin will center it).
- The Big Button has 24px space on the sides, and 8px on top and bottom (padding).

IMPORTANT - FOR PADDING, WHEN TWO VALUES ARE SPCEIFIED, THE FIRST ONE MEANS TOP/BOTTOM AND THE OTHER MEANS LEFT/RIGHT.
